To sum up skills gained at work in headless e-commerce, I've decided to pick up a design for an e-commerce website, so I could use Stitches, TypeScript, Next.js and set Sanity up as CMS.

<h1><code>Overview</code></h1>

>Users should be able to:
>
>- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
>- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
>- Add/Remove products from the cart
>- Edit product quantities in the cart
>- Fill in all fields in the checkout
>- Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout
>- See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart
>- Shipping always adds $50 to the order
>- VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping
>- See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary
>- Bonus: Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser (localStorage could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)

### What I learned

Even though I've worked with Next.js, Stitches and Sanity for a while, I've never started a project from the scratch before. I've had to build up reusable components and architecture, which for sure was a valuable learning process. 

### Continued development

It is a big project with many possible future developments. The first things I would love to change would probably be adding a page builder: something that is possible with Sanity and requires a lot of resources, but I think would be a great test for me as a developer.
